                            whole project, a sceleton. This step considers ergonomic issue of space, apartment's

Usually client doesn't properly understand how project will look like on the outside. Full visualiztion helps client to feel what to expect when constructing will be finished.

Pure architectural part doesn't give any understanding of how future building will be presented in custom surrounding, but visualization does.
